- Inferrable semantics?
  - A little bit tricky to make work!

- unsafePerformIO and use specification at compile time?
  - It might be tricky to guarantee no inlining...

- model concatenation for idiv properly
  - or always sign extend

- improve errors for preconditions
  - push/pop
  - idiv

- allow preconditions on function arguments
  (for instance, so you could implement div and mod)
  - not clear how to make that work!

- get rid of undef?

- An interesting example

- Outline talk
  - Be explicit about what's the trusted code
  - How to present implementation? Be nice to do some incremental typing.
