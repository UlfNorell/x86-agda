- Inferrable semantics?
  - A little bit tricky to make work!

- unsafePerformIO and use specification at compile time?
  - It might be tricky to guarantee no inlining...

- model concatenation for idiv properly
  - or always sign extend

- get rid of undef?
  - no used when pushing past the (previous) top of the stack

- could I do loops?
  - would need to compute addresses in compiler (easy)
  - type safety (hard)
  - target: implement gcd
    - requires wf recursion!

- An interesting example

- Set up some benchmarking to show that it's blazingly fast!
  Need a moderately interesting example for that. Some pseudo random number
  generation?

  Problem: casting between CInt and Integer!

  Might be that I need loops to make it actually faster.

- Outline talk
  - Be explicit about what's the trusted code
  - How to present implementation? Be nice to do some incremental typing.

  - Phase 1: Straighline code (no div)
  - Phase 2: Custom preconditions: x quot y
  - Phase 3: Loops
  - Phase 4: Loops with semantics
